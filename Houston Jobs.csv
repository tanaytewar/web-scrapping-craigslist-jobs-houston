About:
We are a startup looking to form partnerships with restaurant consultants who can help sign up restaurants for our 100% free service. Our founders are from Airbnb and Google. 

Cheqout is a free contactless mobile ordering and payments solution. It essentially turns every customer‚Äôs phone into a personal kiosk that sends orders and payments to restaurants‚Äô POS systems. We provide QR code placards to place on tables or outside restaurants. Customers pull out their phone camera, scan the code, and this opens the restaurant‚Äôs menu on our mobile website, where customers can order and pay. Cheqout is not an app, so it works with any phone. 

This means customers no longer have to touch a credit card reader, touch a menu, wait in line, or even wait for a waiter. They just scan the QR code (wherever you place it inside or outside the restaurant) and they can order and pay. 

Cheqout is 100% free for restaurants, and we can set it up at any restaurant in less than an hour.  

Our Referral Program:
We are offering to share profits 50/50 for 12 months for every restaurant you can help us sign up. 

To get started, please Apply Here.

Other questions? Reply to this listing and we will be happy to discuss.

Attention all healthcare professionals! Surrogacy is a rewarding experience for everyone involved. 


 You don‚Äôt have to choose between surrogacy or a job. You can do surrogacy as a stay-at-home mom or as a second job, all while getting compensated for it. We admire your desire to give the most beautiful gift in the world to a family, while financially helping your own.




""In my quest to fulfill my dream of helping a family through surrogacy I
researched several agencies in the California area. I found so many great 
reviews on Physician's Surrogacy. I called and the staff was quick to 
answer all my questions. They certainly helped put my mind at ease and 
was the first agency (I called several) tat I spoke with where I finally  
sensed ""this is where I belong.""



Your safety and happiness are our primary concern. A surrogacy journey is an emotional and complex medical process that can change lives and bring joy to all involved. Our team of physicians work diligently to ensure a safe and smooth journey. Take the first step by completing your application today to find out if you're eligible. Did you know you can earn up to $11,000 before you are even pregnant? 





Physician's Surrogacy is the leading surrogacy agency in San Diego, with the largest program in North America, providing comprehensive agency services for more than 20 years.

       Our in-house physicians and caring surrogacy coordinators will be happy to guide you through our surrogacy process. Also, our in-house OB liaison can answer any medical questions you may have. Together, we have over 150+ combined years of clinical and professional experience.


Basic Criteria:


Ages 20-37 years old
Have had at least one child of your own
No major complications during pregnancy and/or delivery
Live a healthy lifestyle (no drugs, smoking and healthy body weight)
Arizona, California, Colorado, DC, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont,  or Washington Resident






First Time Surrogacy Compensation Starts At 



Our compensation package is hard to beat, but if you find a higher package, we will happily match it.
		Second or third time surrogates will qualify for higher compensation. 
		As with most agencies, compensation is commensurate with experience, and experienced 
		surrogates will qualify for higher compensation. At Physician's Surrogacy, we believe 
		surrogates should be compensated for the time, commitment, and physical sacrifices 
		made during their journey.





The Ultimate Surrogacy Experience:


           With our monthly support groups, dedicated support teams, and lifetime opportunity, we provide a convenient, caring, and experienced environment for this beautiful journey. One of our experienced Surrogate Coordinators would love to speak with you and answer any questions you may have.







Have Questions Before You Apply? 


            We offer informal information calls to make sure that surrogacy is right for you and your family. To further enhance your decision-making process, you can also call or text to set an appointment to visit our facility.  Feel free to 
chat with us on our website if you have any further questions.

171,Become a Business Broker,Houston,Feb  8,https://houston.craigslist.org/bus/d/houston-become-business-broker/7274475306.html,"

QR Code Link to This Post


Currently we have the leads appointments, administrative support and training bandwidth to sell 6¬† businesses per month. However, with our current Business Broker count, we are hitting those numbers. Simply put, we don't have the business brokers to service the business we have coming in, let alone for the rest 2021.¬†¬†

Q What is Business Broker?
A Business Brokers help business owners find buyers for their businesses.

Q How do we do this?
A You will receive first class training on how to talk to the business owners. Buyers will find you through our massive advertising on business sales web sites. (BizBuySell.com)

Q How do I get paid?
A. We charge a Business Owner up to 15 % based on the selling price or $15,000 minimum, which we collect when the business is transferred to the new owner. The agent starts at a 50% split of the fee and it goes up from there.

Q Who is First Choice Business Brokers?
A We have been in business since 1994. We are a National Business Brokerage Franchise with offices around the US with over 7 Billion in transactions.

Q Is this a salaried position?
A. Business sales is a commission profession. However, you can expect to earn $60,000.00 to $80,000 your first year if you follow our training and our system. This is NOT a job, it is a career.

Q How was Business Sales affected by the recession?
A Almost no effect since business sales are not related to residential sales. Our business sales were strong during and after the recession.

Q Is this an overcrowded profession, in other words is there a lot of competition?
A There are very few Business Brokers. Our National Organization (IBBA) has approximately 600 to 800 members Worldwide. There are only 4,000 Business Brokers in the entire US. As a comparison, in Las Vegas, there are 16,000 realtors and only THIRTY (30) Business Brokers.

Q. How is the current economy affecting Business Sales?
A. One word could answer this question, Booming. We have seen more buyers in these last few years who want to join in the growth of the New York Region. Sellers are also looking to sell to move onto other business opportunities. We have always found that the Buyers are always looking to take advantage of growing industries. According to Fox Business Report, Business Sales were up 49% over previous years. Now is certainly the time to enter our profession.

Q What is the preferred background of a successful agent?
A Professional sales, prior business owners, advertising sales, insurance agents, CPA's, mortgage professionals., You should be someone who is willing to learn the business and able to understand why a person is in business and why a buyer wants to be self-employed.

Q Do I need to be an accountant or have an accounting background?
A Although we do have quite a few former accountants in our group, an accounting background is NOT required.

Q. What else is required?
A. You must be able present yourself in a professional manner to clients.

Q. Can I keep my other job while getting licensed and receiving training?
A. We understand that this may be necessary and we will work with qualified candidates.

Q. What Does It Cost?
A. Training costs $600. Monthly Fee $175 Plus whatever you decide to spend on your own marketing. We suggest a monthly marketing budget of $1,000.00

Q How do I get started?
A Contact our office at 713-400-7663

Q. What else do I need to know?
Go to our website and fill out the contact form: https://houstontxbusinessesforsale.com/join-our-team ","
compensation: The agent starts at a 50% split of the fee and it goes up from there. Business sales is a commission profession.

https://www.benjamin-benjamin.com (FREE Training on DEMAND Videos)


Right now, there are millions of owners of commercial properties of all types struggling financially due to the pandemic. According to RealtyTrac, pre-foreclosures have increased a staggering 19% in the past 12 months. And, while President Biden has extended the moratorium on foreclosure protection through March 2021, the moratorium only applied to residential, NOT commercial properties. The leading factor for the high level of vacancies and foreclosures in the commercial real estate markets is the inability to secure traditional tenants. Fortunately, prior to and especially during the pandemic, Benjamin & Benjamin, Inc. has found a fantastic lucrative solution to fund, take over and repurpose many vacant commercial properties across the United States.

All you'll be doing is providing them what they already want!

https://www.benjamin-benjamin.com (FREE Training on DEMAND Videos)


Clients will gladly pay you up to 10% commission or Assignment FEES, because you'll be able to actually facilitate the solution they've been intently looking for.

Top-ranked proprietary trading firm, Maverick Trading, is searching for entrepreneurially-minded, profit-driven people to be trained in the art and science of proprietary trading in its online foreign exchange trading division, Maverick FX.  Successful candidates will trade foreign currencies with the firm's capital on behalf of the firm and reap the majority share of the profits.

As one of the best proprietary Forex trading firms in the industry, Maverick FX offers its traders impressive capital and leverage, comprehensive training, and extensive support and mentoring.  We teach our traders how to trade in the Forex market.  Maverick FX's capital base, training, and reputation has allowed us to partner with the top currency trading broker to offer our traders tighter spreads and better execution than the typical retail Forex firm.

The Forex market is open 23-1/2 hours a day, five days a week.  This time horizon allows the firm to offer its traders flexible hours and the ability to start part-time and transition into full-time trading.  Prop forex trading is a mentally engaging, challenging profession where diligence and consistency translate directly into financial reward.  In other words, this is truly meaningful work.  The firm's traders have the opportunity to practice their craft from anywhere in the world via high-speed internet.

---About Maverick Trading FX Division---

Started in 1997, Maverick Trading is one of the most experienced prop trading firms and is ranked as one of the top trading companies in the industry, accepting and funding experienced traders as well as teaching motivated people from all backgrounds how to become traders.  The firm's Maverick FX Division has been actively trading the Forex markets since 2009.  As a result of a long track record of success, the firm has the capital to back and fund its traders with meaningful amounts of capital.

Each trader starts live trading with a minimum of a $10,000 account ($500,000 in buying power) and keeps 70% to 80% of trading profits.  As you gain experience and demonstrate consistent profitability you become eligible for greater amounts of the firm's capital.  Our top traders can trade up to $300,000 ($15 million in buying power).  Profitable traders are also eligible for Performance Bonuses.

---How to Apply---

Our application process is multi-step and designed to educate you on prop trading, how we train, support and fund our traders, and how we pay out profits to you, as well as focus you for your interview where you can have any remaining questions answered and discuss with your recruiter why Maverick FX is a good fit for you.
To get started, click on the application link below.  This will take you to a short video that will discuss Maverick FX and its Capital Sharing Program (how you get funded and paid).

When you complete the application process, you will be contacted by one of our experienced recruiters (who are also traders themselves) for a Suitability Interview.

CLICK on the link below to begin the application process:

First of all ‚Äì there is No Cost!!

With all the upheaval in America and unemployment at its highest it may be difficult for some of you to recover if you have to rely on others to offer employment. The SBA and private lenders have plans available for easy business start-up to offset the millions of jobs lost in the past year.

The FDIC created a 13-hour business start-up course to help individuals qualify for funding. The SBA has endorsed this program and offers the online course through Blue Banyan Society at NO COST to you or to any aspiring entrepreneurs wanting to start their own business. Franchises, business purchase and start-ups qualify.

The training is intended to give you the basic knowledge you need to start and run your business successfully.

Our lending partner has provided funding services through private loans and SBA loans since 2004 and has funded over 12,000 Individuals for starting a new business with NO customer complaints with the BBB or any government agency that regulates this service/industry. The rates range from 5% to 12% and the terms are 5 to 8 years doc. Very few companies can claim the same.

Credit is not an issue if you have a score of 550 or higher or can bring in a co-signor or partner with a healthy credit score.

Simply reply with your name and email address if you're interested. We will send you a link to get started.

Also, if you have a true entrepreneurial spirit and want to help others succeed we have a few positions available for Business Counselors due to the high demand we are experiencing for the Business Literacy Program. Counselors have the potential to earn $1500 to $3000 per student enrolled in the free FDIC/SBA Business Literacy Course.    ","

Description of Opportunity:

Are you ready to shape the future? If so, leading students to a better tomorrow could be exactly what you‚Äôre looking for in your next career step. Teaching is a rewarding profession where you can have great influence and continue to make a difference in the world, all while building your professional skill set. It is a profession of possibility. As a teacher, each day presents the promise of possibility. To be a teacher is to be a problem solver, a poet, an inventor, a creator, an explorer, and more. Experience the possibility of untangling a student‚Äôs understanding of numbers, of awakening curiosities that shift life trajectories, and of creating social change. If you want to make a dent in this world, explore your path to teaching.

Teaching is an important and satisfying profession for those who are eternally curious and always looking to innovate. The field of education, now more than ever, is active with debate and exploration about how to make education more effective in preparing our future problem-solvers, from concepts like Personalized Learning to Instructional Leadership, to ideas about the difference between public, private and charter schools, to ways to ensure students are engaged and thrive in distance learning. Thus, as you progress in your career, you‚Äôll have plenty of fodder to keep you stimulated intellectually and challenged professionally.  


Qualifications: 

To be a teacher, you need a few things. 
You need a strong work ethic. As a teacher you‚Äôll work hard, yes, but this is a job where your investment is sure to pay off. For every hour you put in, every exam you administer, every lesson you teach, every pep talk you give, you will reap unparalleled outcomes. Your students will light up when they master the subjects you‚Äôve taught them to love. You‚Äôll establish bonds of trust that allow you to influence their lives. And you‚Äôll get to work with subject matter that interests you. Nobody likes to be bored, but don't worry, you won‚Äôt have that problem.

You need to have high expectations for all students. If you believe that your students can run a NASA command center, manage a corporate boardroom, thrive in a laboratory, master an art studio, succeed in an operating room‚Äîso will they. In the classroom, your influence impacts their dreams and sense of curiosity. Teaching allows you to constantly imagine new and effective ways to reach young minds. 

You need a diverse set of skills: leadership, creative problem-solving, and stellar communication, to name a few more. Simply put, the practice of teaching will naturally help you deepen your talents to increase your influence, impact, and professional abilities. 


How to Apply:

Choosing the right profession is a big deal and TEACH is here to provide you with everything that you might need to determine if teaching is a fit and, if so, where you can find a job once you have your teaching credentials. We‚Äôll help you navigate the different pathways to become a teacher based on the qualifications and experience you already bring to the table. Let us help you make an impact.

- Our tutors will have complete flexibility over their rate and schedule‚Äîgetting the pay that they deserve while also setting their own availability. 
- Being accepted as a tutor by TutorBee does not guarantee any set number of hours. Student requests will be provided as they become available, and tutors will have the opportunity to accept or decline any opportunities offered.
- Tutors will be required to complete a set number of training sessions before working with students. All training will be paid at the tutor‚Äôs hourly rate.

Qualifications:
- You must be an expert (able to currently score in at least the 90th percentile) in at least one of the subjects below. If we decide to move forward, we will ask you to take an online, proctored proficiency test in the AP or SAT subject you are interested in teaching.
-- SAT + ACT reading comprehension + English grammar
-- SAT + ACT math
-- AP BC Calculus
-- GMAT Quantitative Section
-- LSAT (all sections)
-- AP Level C + SAT Chemistry
-- AP + SAT Biology
-- AP + SAT Physics

- Have a 4-year university degree
- Have stable internet connection

Are you searching for a better life for yourself and your family? In 2011 I moved from Russia to the USA pursuing ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù. But in reality it turned out to be a nightmare! It is the country of unlimited opportunities where you can make so much money and create comfortable living... as long as you hustle and work hard.

The dark side of that reality is that you have to sacrifice everything else in your life - your health and your well being, precious time with your loved ones, your dreams, all the fun and joy in life, living from paycheck to paycheck just enough to cover all your bills and survive‚Ä¶And you are never in control of your life. Any second you can get fired, lose your job, especially right now as we live in very unstable times with everything that is going on with this world crisis.

What‚Äôs going to happen tomorrow? Scary reality, right?

But it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Making money doesn‚Äôt have to be painful and you don‚Äô t have to struggle just to get by in search of the next job.

That was my reality before and now I am living my best life, I am no longer worried about money and how I am going to support myself.

You know the difference between rich and poor people? Rich people are getting richer and richer even in times like right now. The best part YOU can be one of them! You are meant to live a happy, successful abundant life! And now is the best time!

What if you could get access to the same information and knowledge wealthy rich people use to get rich?

I found a way to create passive income and build true solid wealth for years to come! And I want to share this opportunity with you if you are ready to take it. There is more than enough for everyone. And making money can be easy and fun with the right opportunities.

Sign up for your free training that we created to educate you how the process works and how this opportunity can potentially change your entire life!

Our SAT/ACT prep program learns the strengths and weaknesses of each student and creates an individualized learning program through machine learning. It also motivates students to study through clear structure and behavioral feedback. You can think of it as an automated tutor that provides a compelling learning experience at scale. We also have a large organic content project with over a million monthly visitors to our free tools and articles. We believe we have a major advantage over other companies in our space because of our technology-centered and analytical approach to education.

You'll join PrepScholar as a full stack engineer and work on projects to grow our company within test prep and beyond. You'll improve our prep program by building new features, using large datasets to iterate on A/B tests, and scaling to handle thousands of users. You'll develop free tools and data presentations to give millions of families worldwide better information to guide their decisions. You'll be a core part of our growth as we scale to becoming a national education brand.

We're a team of 10+ and growing, and we're based in Cambridge, MA next to the Charles River. Check us out at www.prepscholar.com

Skills & Requirements
We're looking for a generalist who enjoys learning and working with different technologies along the stack.

Our stack:
Sass, JQuery, Backbone
Django/Python
MySQL
AWS/Linux

Requirements:
+Strong foundation in computer science and software engineering, including competencies in data structures, algorithms, databases, software design and dev ops.

+Strong hands-on experience with our core technologies is a big plus. In particular:

+Python and Django

+JavaScript and JavaScript MV* frameworks like AngularJS, Ember, Knockout, or Backbone

Ideal candidate has:
+Experience deploying frequently

+Willingness to try new things and pick up new technologies quickly

+UX intuition and an eye for design

+Ability to work independently with low management overhead

+Excitement about startups in growth mode and about our company mission

+Location in Boston or willingness to relocate (Full WFH during COVID; partial WFH options after)

About Us
+Founded in 2013. We're profitable, growing, and bootstrapped, so you'll have stability and ability to build out a long-term vision.

+We have a lot of room to grow within test prep and education at large.

+We have a team of 20 full-time members and more part-time instructors.

+We have thousands of customers and a growing footprint of millions of visitors.

+We care about culture and a great work environment. We're flexible with schedule, have no scheduled overtime, conduct efficient meetings, and want minimal bureaucracy.

+We offer relocation assistance.

+You'll be building something meaningful. Education is a linchpin of our country's economy and empowers people to improve their own lives. For many reasons, education suffers throughout the country -- class sizes too large, methods outdated, teachers underpaid. Here's your chance to build a scalable solution that actually has impact.

Comments from a current Carroll Fulmer Driver on social media‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..



 
""Love Carroll Fulmer Logistics, been with em two years now. Always good miles, I average 2800-3200 every week and go home 7 days. I'm always home on time or early. Never late. They always take personal attention to my personal needs and my family. Helped me out during hard times, or sickness. When I'm given a load, I'm offered usually two or three options and asked, when can I pick it up, and when can I deliver it. I always have 1 or 2 preplans ahead of time. No swaps unless it works in your favor. Road service is easy to get ahold of. And best of all, no micromanagement. Great feel without the big company BS. They really do make you feel like family here. I've even had no problem speaking to the President personally before and it was a very pleasant experience."" ‚Äî Troy Townsend, Carroll Fulmer Driver

QR Code Link to This Post


Remote Work From Home - Moving Sales - $2,000 Per Week 

We are in search of experienced one call closers -  no moving experience req.  

We have been in business for many many years, with sales reps who¬†have been working with us since day one, earning an amazing¬†income...

all while working from home. 

We are not brokers...

We are the actual Carrier! 

We generate enough leads on a daily basis to keep you on the phone, closing deals. 

Having qualified leads to speak to will never be an issue. 

This is a 1099 position, meaning that you are your own boss. 

The only cost to working with us is having your own internet connection, headset and a computer, other than that...

We provide everything else, including:

* Newly Generated Leads (we spend thousands of dollars per day on leads for you to close)

* Live Transfers 

* Training & Support

* Floor Managers who will jump on a call to help you close a deal (and you keep all the commission)

* Available work schedule from 8:00 am to midnight, Monday - Sunday, choose what hours you want to work, as long as its Full Time.

* Top commission, so you can earn amazing income while working from home. 

* We are an A rated carrier - this alone is one of the big selling points, as customers want to have a sense of trust and security with who they are entrusting their household¬†items to 

What we are looking for: 

* Someone that can work Full-Time. At the end of each week, you submit your work schedule for the following week, so you get to set your own hours. We just need to know what days and hours you intend on working so we can have enough leads for you to speak with. 

* Someone with one call closing experience. We are not looking for someone that sold girl scout cookies at a kiosk in Walmart. We need actual CLOSERS, who can pull credit cards on the first call and close the deal. 

* A Hardcore closer. In this business, you eat what you kill. No sales equals no paycheck. You CAN NOT be scared of asking for the order and closing the deal. 

Think about this... there are thousands of people moving across the country..literally thousands of them. Either due to job transfers or change of life events. 

These people/families hire moving companies to move their stuff. 

We offer a service that they need and want... all we need you to do is pick up the phone and close the deals.. they are there waiting for you to call. 

Here is the next step. 

Please note, we normally get 100s of applications from sales reps per week to work for our company.. most of which are not qualified and basically are tire kickers. 

We are not looking to waste our time, we are only looking for closers that want to earn a MBA (Massive Bank Account) and are willing to work hard. 

We need to differentiate these real closers from those who are going to waste our time. 
In the next step we are going to ask you some questions and ask you to leave us a voicemail to a number that we provide.

DO NOT half answer these questions on the application, actually give detailed answers related to your background... and make sure to complete step 2, which is leaving a voicemail.

Hi my name is Jim Garofalo and I am the President of Professional Coin Galleries. If there were ever a time to sell 
Gold/Silver Rare Coins over the phone to collectors and investors it's NOW!! As of this posting( 2/2/21 ) Gold is $1840 an ounce and Silver is $$28.99 an ounce today. I am an Original Member of Stratton Oakmont. ( The Wolf of Wall Street ) I worked for that firm from 1989-1996, and I would work there a 100 times over again. What I learned there as a young kid out of college was work ethic and how to put my head down and grind it out over the phone! Ladies and Gentleman when it comes to training salespeople to sell Numismatic graded coins over the telephone from home I am hands down #1 in the country. I opened the doors to this company in 2009 and in almost 13 years we have NEVER done the business that we are doing now. 2020 in a pandemic we did $9,400,000.00 in sales. What I have instituted from the very beginng is that we bring a Wall Street mentality to the coin industry. 

Gold, Silver, Platinum and Palladium are at historic record level's that the world has never seen before, and looks to be going much much higher. We believe and many experts alike that the precious metals have a least a 5 year bull run ahead of us. Warren Buffet the most successful investor in our lifetime recently invested a half a billion dollars into physical Gold and an obnoxious amount of Silver. Funny thing is in all his years he has NEVER invested in the precious metals. Thats got to tell you something. Now is the time! Not only for you, but for your clients to make a fortune. Not many times in life can you catch lighting in a bottle. The window is open!! The stock market is being held up by 10 stocks. Tree's grow to the sky, but eventually they stop! This is the time for the precious metals. 

We had to close our NYC office on 24th Street and Park Ave on March 19 due to Covet-19 and let to let 41 people go. 
We were in that space for 7 years. We also had to close our Boca Raton office. So at the end of April we decided to train salespeople via Zoom. We have had eight different one week classes since and I am extremely happy with the results of our sales teams that we have created through Zoom. We have also learned a lot since we have started these classes and the type of salespeople we are looking for in the new 2021 class. Expert Telemarketer?? Expert Financial Advisor?? You better be!! You will see that making $1000 a day is like shooting fish in a barrel. You will meet people like Tim, Randy, Peter, Tami that have been with us only 5 months that made over $200,000 each in that time period. 

Our next class starts on Monday February 8th at 10 am EST. The class will go for 7 days Monday-Friday then on Monday and Tuesday. On Tuesday your last class we will get you on the phones. In order to be successful you need the full 7 days. Classes will run aprox 3 hours a day. I make them fun and they will go quick. We will give you major support and provide you with all the leads of coin collectors and investors that have purchased coins in the past. We pay 35% commission of the profit of the sale. ( Highest paid commission in the Nation ) We pay once a week on a 1099. I charge you nothing for the training, but I could certainly market the training and ask people to pay for it, it's that good! This is a real Job! Expect to work 8-10 hours a day. We have the data. If you make 300 dials a day you will be on your way to making $300,000+ in 2021. We have a A+ rating withe the Better Business Bureau and we are Accredited with the BBB. After 13 years we are pretty proud of that rating. Go to our website pcgalleries.com. and check it out. If you don't have at least 5 years experience of serious telemarketing, please don't apply. If you meet the qualifications for the position call me at 516-369-0523 and ill see if I can get you into the upcoming class on February 8th. If you work really hard I promise you that you will never forget me. ill never let you down! JG

Right now, there are millions of owners of commercial properties of all types struggling financially due to the pandemic. According to RealtyTrac, pre-foreclosures have increased a staggering 19% in the past 12 months. And, while President Biden has extended the moratorium on foreclosure protection through March 2021, the moratorium only applied to residential, NOT commercial properties. The leading factor for the high level of vacancies and foreclosures in the commercial real estate markets is the inability to secure traditional tenants.

Are you coachable and teachable enough to qualify to Trade OUR money in the Financial Markets? We trade mainly Futures and Forex and we‚Äôll share with you why! WE take the risk and YOU keep 50% to 80% of the profits. We‚Äôre a 10 year old company with thousands of traders/members worldwide. You don‚Äôt punch a time clock with us! Many of our traders only trade 1 or 2 hours a day, on their schedule, in the comfort of their home or office.

We will show you our trading tools in action. Most importantly, we will allow you to TRY OUR TRADING TOOLS for a full 30 days, so you can experience it for yourself and qualify to trade our money!

Have you ever wanted to learn to day trade but,

1) You don‚Äôt know how to start

2) You lack the capital to invest

3) You thought trading was too risky

If so, you are certainly not alone. Most people cite these reasons for not attempting it.

We solved these issues by doing what NO ONE ELSE WOULD DO!

1) We will teach you, step-by-step, with an EXPERIENCED, SUCCESSFUL personal coach, trading with you and using our proprietary PREDICTIVE indicators. So, you will know exactly how to profitably trade with CONFIDENCE.

2) Once you are trained and qualified, we will FUND AN ACCOUNT FOR YOU WITH OUR COMPANY FUNDS, up to $100,000 over time based on performance, so the income potential is exceptional!

3) We take ALL the risk. Even so, when you are profitable, YOU keep 50% to 80% of the profits. If you lose money (and practically everyone loses some as they are learning), you lose OUR money (which, by the way, you NEVER have to pay back). Naturally, since we both are interested in your success, we work hard to ensure that you don‚Äôt lose money, but are consistently profitable. 

Some may ask ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhy would your company do this?‚Äù

The reasons are simple: We have been doing this for years and have trained 1,000‚Äôs of individuals, from a wide range of backgrounds, to trade our system. 

Finally, any experienced trader will tell you that one of the most critical aspects of trading is dealing with the FEAR and EMOTIONS of trading your own money, meaning, most traders can be successful ‚Äúpractice‚Äù trading (without real money) but, once they start trading with their own real money at risk, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwhole different ball game‚Äù, which the vast majority of people cannot handle ‚Äî and they end up losing their money and quitting.

But, when they trade OUR money, the pressure is off and they can trade with much the same calmness and confidence as when they were practice trading. As they trade with our money, they keep most of the profits and we keep the lesser portion.

So, we have created a WIN-WIN scenario for everyone involved.

We have had great success with our traders, but we have LIMITED spots available.

Again, our traders come from virtually all backgrounds, so it really comes down to ""first come -- first-placed"".

Time is of the essence, so fill out the application and we will be in touch with you.

https://trydaytrading.com/careers-houston-finance/

This is not in any way an offer or solicitation for you to buy or sell any securities to or from us. All trading is done on dummy accounts to learn how to trade or done in the accounts of others who give you permission to make trades in their accounts, and not with your own money. We are not licensed to offer or purchase securities, and thus do not offer or solicit the sale or purchase of securities by you from us. This is not a get-rich-quick program or business opportunity. We provide training and trading tools. We make no promises that our training and tools will generate future income for students, and you may not make your investment back.    ","

About:
We are a startup looking to form partnerships with restaurant consultants who can help sign up restaurants for our 100% free service. Our founders are from Airbnb and Google. 

Cheqout is a free contactless mobile ordering and payments solution. It essentially turns every customer‚Äôs phone into a personal kiosk that sends orders and payments to restaurants‚Äô POS systems. We provide QR code placards to place on tables or outside restaurants. Customers pull out their phone camera, scan the code, and this opens the restaurant‚Äôs menu on our mobile website, where customers can order and pay. Cheqout is not an app, so it works with any phone. 

This means customers no longer have to touch a credit card reader, touch a menu, wait in line, or even wait for a waiter. They just scan the QR code (wherever you place it inside or outside the restaurant) and they can order and pay. 

Cheqout is 100% free for restaurants, and we can set it up at any restaurant in less than an hour.  

Our Referral Program:
We are offering to share profits 50/50 for 12 months for every restaurant you can help us sign up. 

To get started, please Apply Here.

Other questions? Reply to this listing and we will be happy to discuss.

Analysts are given the tools and trained in the skills necessary to accomplish this task. However, successful analysts have attributes that cannot be taught. They are strong, dynamic, confident teachers, communicators and leaders with exceptional understanding and empathy.

This position requires 10 years of executive, sales or business ownership experience, analytical skills and the ability to communicate effectively with business owners, senior management and boards of directors. Ideal candidates for this position are individuals who have previously owned their own businesses and/or have held upper management positions for a minimum of five years. A four-year degree is strongly preferred but we will consider candidates with strong business experience. 75%-90% travel, leaving on Sunday returning on Friday-home weekends. We are looking for candidates who are available within the next 30 days.

Global Resources offers a comprehensive training program; full benefits pkg. with 401k; this is not a salaried position-this is a fully commissioned employee position with the average first year in the low six figures and higher thereafter.

Please forward resume to Kerri Parks via our website:

Moms! What if you could help give the most beautiful gift in the world to another family while financially helping your own?


Surrogacy is a rewarding experience for everyone involved. You don‚Äôt have to choose between surrogacy or a job. You can do surrogacy as a stay-at-home mom or as a second job, all while getting compensated for it. We admire your desire to give the most beautiful gift in the world to a family, while financially helping your own. 




""In my quest to fulfill my dream of helping a family through surrogacy I
researched several agencies in the California area. I found so many great 
reviews on Physician's Surrogacy. I called and the staff was quick to 
answer all my questions. They certainly helped put my mind at ease and 
was the first agency (I called several) tat I spoke with where I finally  
sensed ""this is where I belong.""



Your safety and happiness are our primary concern. A surrogacy journey is an emotional and complex medical process that can change lives and bring joy to all involved. Our team of physicians work diligently to ensure a safe and smooth journey. Take the first step by completing your application today to find out if you're eligible. Did you know you can earn up to $11,000 before you are even pregnant? 





Physician's Surrogacy is the leading surrogacy agency in San Diego, with the largest program in North America, providing comprehensive agency services for more than 20 years.

       Our in-house physicians and caring surrogacy coordinators will be happy to guide you through our surrogacy process. Also, our in-house OB liaison can answer any medical questions you may have. Together, we have over 150+ combined years of clinical and professional experience.


Basic Criteria:


Ages 20-37 years old
Have had at least one child of your own
No major complications during pregnancy and/or delivery
Live a healthy lifestyle (no drugs, smoking and healthy body weight)
Arizona, California, Colorado, DC, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont,  or Washington Resident






First Time Surrogacy Compensation Starts At 



Our compensation package is hard to beat, but if you find a higher package, we will happily match it.
		Second or third time surrogates will qualify for higher compensation. 
		As with most agencies, compensation is commensurate with experience, and experienced 
		surrogates will qualify for higher compensation. At Physician's Surrogacy, we believe 
		surrogates should be compensated for the time, commitment, and physical sacrifices 
		made during their journey.





The Ultimate Surrogacy Experience:


           With our monthly support groups, dedicated support teams, and lifetime opportunity, we provide a convenient, caring, and experienced environment for this beautiful journey. One of our experienced Surrogate Coordinators would love to speak with you and answer any questions you may have.







Have Questions Before You Apply? 


            We offer informal information calls to make sure that surrogacy is right for you and your family. To further enhance your decision-making process, you can also call or text to set an appointment to visit our facility.  Feel free to 
chat with us on our website if you have any further questions.

We are looking for someone who is confident, ambitious, has a strong work ethic, and someone who is coachable. We are seeking representatives from entry level to experienced professionals.
We offer swift advancement and management opportunities. We provide a generous training program. A program that guides you to continuous improvement in order to reach your personal goals and stay on course.. All of this in a culture of personal and professional enrichment. This is a company you can trust to build a future with.
Each week we mail thousands of letters to people who just bought or refinanced a home in the area. Our letter states that their mortgage can be paid off in the event of their death or make the mortgage payments in case of a disability or critical illness like cancer, heart attack or stroke. At the end of the term, if our clients outlive the policy, they receive all of their money back.
We offer the best products on the market. We specialize in mortgage protection, final expense, and retirement planning. Products with top A-rated companies that pay great commissions and long term financial growth.
The clients that are interested in our product will personally fill out our questionnaire (age, birth date, smoking status, best phone number and time to contact them) they will then mail the completed questionnaire back to us. *NO COLD CALLING*
Typically, commission on a mortgage protection product is about $600 per family you protect. Yes, it is full commission but our average full time underwriter will sell 4 to 5 mortgage protection plans a week.
You will need your life insurance license or be willing to get that license. We can assist with that process.
A part time agent is one who is willing to commit to a consistent part time schedule each week. Full time is 30+ hours per week.

THIS IS A WORK FROM HOME POSITION WHERE YOU'LL COLD CALL REAL ESTATE AGENTS WITH OUR ADVANCED INTERNET-BASED DIALING SYSTEM TO OFFER THEM A FREE 7 TRIAL OF OUR SERVICE... IT'S A VERY EASY SALE!

WHO IS PRESS LIKE?
Press Like is the number one platform helping modern real estate agents succeed on social media without having to do any of the work themselves. Even though some businesses are struggling through these tough times, interest rates just hit record lows, and the real estate industry across America is booming! Based on a recent study done by the National Association of Realtors, 74% of home buyers and sellers will look up Realtors social media presence before calling them to do business. So it is no longer a choice for them to have a unique social media presence to separate themselves from their competition; they need one! We are currently the industry leader trusted by the largest real estate brokerages on the planet. At Press Like, we may have a start-up vibe, but this is not our first rodeo. We've been in this space for eight years and serviced thousands of clients, and we are growing daily!

NOW HIRING
1099 work from home phone sales consultants to support our outstanding growth in the US market. Full-time sales positions will bring in on average $900-$1,900 per week. Part-time sales positions will make less depending on the hours that you put in. If you show promise, learn the structure, produce consistent sales, show leadership qualities, you could be put on a fast track to management and be trained how to help newer people get off to a great start. That is also a very lucrative position. The management team works around the clock to help with your success. You will have the opportunity to call Realtors Monday through Friday during their business hours. We have daily Zoom meetings on the weekdays where we roleplay with each other and share sales techniques to get better every day. There is a beautiful bonus structure, daily jackpots, along with weekly and monthly bonuses that reward consistency to ensure that you will always make a great living while growing along the way.

WHAT TO EXPECT
We have lots of training videos and scripts for you to go over before you start. There is live in-call coaching with lots of virtual meetings and role-playing to improve yourself daily. You log onto our system with a good internet connection and a headset with a microphone. Within 1 minute of logging in, a real estate agent with all of their information will connect to your headset. You read through the perfect script word for word, add your personality to be yourself, and build a tremendous human connection throughout the call. If you get stuck, don't worry, we are listening and will talk you through where to navigate and what to say, and the clients won't be able to hear us. If you want help on a call, and you are not sure if anyone is listening, then you use the walkie-talkie feature that everyone downloads on their phone, so we are just a push of the button away!

WHY SHOULD YOU JOIN OUR TEAM?
‚úì Great company with a service that real estate agents must have!
‚úì Endless income potential!
‚úì Weekly pay period!
‚úì No contract, commitment, or upfront cost for our clients to get started... Easy Sale! 
‚úì Stability - Almost every new person from last week made at least one sale on their first full day!
‚úì Flexibility - Work a full-time schedule in any time zone across the US! 
‚úì Training - You'll have the actual scripts that have brought us millions of dollars in sales! 
‚úì On-going daily development!
‚úì Access to six-figure top producers who are happy to help!
‚úì State of the art software!
‚úì Easy calling system with leads built-in!
‚úì The product dominates what our competition provides hands down!

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
‚Ä¢ One year of experience in direct sales, preferably over the phone! 
‚Ä¢ Someone not timid to ask for the sale with class and respect... Then ask again!
‚Ä¢ Highly motivated positive thinker, with a strong work ethic!
‚Ä¢ Success is an obligation!
‚Ä¢ Great phone presence with a pleasant vocal tonality!
‚Ä¢ Willing to implement a proven system with an open mind!
‚Ä¢ Can read a sales script perfectly like a paid actor or actress while thinking off the cuff!
‚Ä¢ Confident personality!

HOW TO APPLY:
2. Email us your resume.
3. Check for our email reply letting you know if you are invited to the interview.
4. If invited, join the Zoom meeting interview at 5:00 PM PST with the ID # we give you and possibly start as soon as Monday.

The seats are limited to how many people we can assist at once, so your resume submission timing will affect your opportunity to get started. Please take a look at our website http://www.presslike.com to see examples of the service we provide and watch a video of us in the Portland Oregon office Pre-COVID!

Right now, there are millions of owners of commercial properties of all types struggling financially due to the pandemic.  According to RealtyTrac, pre-foreclosures have increased a staggering 19% in the past 12 months. And, while President Biden has extended the moratorium on foreclosure protection through March 2021, the moratorium only applied to residential, NOT commercial properties.  The leading factor for the high level of vacancies and foreclosures in the commercial real estate markets is the inability to secure traditional tenants.

All you'll be doing is providing them what they already want!

https://www.benjamin-benjamin.com (FREE Training on DEMAND Videos)

Currently seeking full-time employment within the greater Houston and surrounding areas. 
I have over 19 years of experience in accounts receivable, payable, sales & use tax, inventory audit, audit coordination and collections. I am currently working towards my associate degree and I am looking for a full time position with benefits. I live in SW Montgomery County and would be willing to drive Downtown or the Galleria area. I am available to start work immediately as I am not employed and would have no problems passing a background check or drug test. I have interviewed several times over the past 2 months and have been told that I am either over qualified or because I do not have my degree /CPA I would not be considered. In my previous role I worked  in the sales & use tax department for one of Houston`s top workplaces in the energy sector. I have performed the work of a CPA while traveling to field locations and performed audit inspections on drilling equipment and casing. I have excellent organizational and communication skills. I've worked collaboratively with various departments and levels of management with my previous employer. I have a positive attitude and friendly disposition but as I've said it seems because I do not have a degree I am in this bucket of either too much experience or not being considered. I am a quick learner with excellent ERP skills; SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Office, Excel, AS400, Excalibur, JD Edward's, DocVue, Sharepoint, Oildex, Energylink, Access, and Getpaid to name a few. I have experience in cash receipts, as well as monthly account reconciliations, journal entries and have handled multiple close processes during month end. I consider myself an advanced beginner in EXCEL as I am not familiar with macros. However I have some exposure to VLookups I have no problem creating pivot tables. Any referrals or suggestions for a accounting position within the chemical, energy, construction, manufacturing or banking sectors would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks for your time. Have a great day!

2091,"Fund Manager,  DAY TRADE OUR COMPANY MONEY, Part-Time At Home We Train","Online Anywhere, Home, Office, Travel, ...",Jan 31,https://houston.craigslist.org/sls/d/houston-fund-manager-day-trade-our/7270497118.html,"

TRADE FUND MANAGER
Work Part-Time.  At Home.  We Train Online.  Trade Our Money Online.

We are a WORK-FROM-HOME company and our day traders did GREAT in 2020!  We are ready to do even better in 2021 with more TRADE-FROM-HOME Fund Managers.  We are getting a fast start by releasing new funded accounts this week to independent contract Trade Fund Managers.

Trade Fund Managers train online to trade online.  They trade our Company Money, trading from home, 1 or so hours a day, 4 or so days a week.

We have all learned over the last weeks and months that we need a backup (or primary) income created from home. The time to get that second backup or primary home based income flowing is before you need it.  We need Trade Fund Managers so apply with us now.  Our 20+ year day trading system and trading our Company money creates an ideal home-generated secondary and even primary income.  We invite you to study this ad.

For years men and women across the country, and the world, have day traded our Company money.  They have sought big extra cash, a lifestyle income, and increased savings and wealth they need and desire day trading our 20+ year system and Company money.  Many have even retired early or more securely.  With our proprietary indicators we even signal you when a trade is ready to take.  Our funded accounts are rare and come available only as we create new accounts.  Our day traders just don‚Äôt give them up.  Our Trade Fund Managers report they are living the way they wanted and doing things financially they never thought possible, and now a reality day trading with us.  Starting part-time, many retire early or more security from their typical jobs and continue a day trading retirement with us working just part-time while still enjoying a lifestyle income and increasing their savings and wealth.

We do this as experience over the years has taught us that men and women day trading part-time at home are more comfortable and make better trades.  Today‚Äôs technology and our techniques makes it all possible.  With our 20+ year system, home day traders do better than so called ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù working all day in the office, being clever with trades, getting tired, and making too many mistakes.  With online Trade Fund Managers, not only is the Company account growing at the greatest rate, but the account is at less risk by being diversified over more people and talent.  By this approach, men and women can earn a great home-based part-time income and we enjoy a greater resulting outcome.  It is a big win ‚Äì win!

Click Here For Details - www.TradeCompanyMoney.com/CLJL1

POSITION
Summary ‚Äì This is a Trade Fund Manager position where you can trade up to $100,000 of our Company money and keep up to 80% of your trade earnings. Train online from home or your office. Day trade online from your home or office.  Most of our fund managers trade just minutes to 1 or so hours a day.  That seems to be enough for them, but you can day trade more to earn more.  Trade any time the market is open.  That is 24 hours a day from Sunday 5 pm Eastern to Friday 5 pm Eastern so it fits with busy schedules.  You are not an employee, as we moved away from that model years ago.  We are looking for independent minded and self-starter people who essentially want to run their own trade account.  You can also use the system to trade your own money as well keeping 100% of your earnings, which many of our Trade Fund Managers do, often from their profits trading our Company money.

Specifics:
WE TRAIN YOU ‚Äì We are committed to your success with extensive 1-to-1 online live personalized training and other online and onsite training formats.  Remember you can trade our money, so we are committed to your training.
WE FUND YOU ‚Äì Part of your education is to trade our Company‚Äôs real money account.  Begin with a starter account and with positive account growth we can quickly add up to a full trade fund of $100,000 of our Company real money.  You can earn all along the way and with a larger trade fund you can earn more without having to trade more.
WE SHOW YOU ‚Äì We have 2 daily online trade webinars to show and train how to find and place real market trades.  Our Trade Fund Managers may see the same trade potential and choose to take these same trades.
WE SIGNAL YOU ‚Äì Use our 20+ year trade secrets and proprietary trade signals that are simple to use and highly predictive.
WE SUPPORT YOU ‚Äì we provide 1-to-1 live personal support.  Call us, text us, email, chat with us, and join in our webinars, seminars, etc.  We are hear to help you trade profitably.
YOU TRADE ‚Äì Simply trade from home or anywhere, a few minutes to 1 or so hours a day, 3 or 4 days a week when the market is open.  That seems to be enough for many of our Trade Fund Managers, but you can trade more to earn more if you choose or trade less if your lifestyle or schedule dictates such.
YOU PROFIT ‚Äì You keep up to 80% of your profits day trading our money.  If you choose to trade any of your profits or other private funds you will keep up to 100% of your earnings.  You traded your money.


REQUIREMENTS
Summary ‚Äì We ask you to trade a minimum of 3 or 4 days a week and place a couple of trades on those days.  Again, you can trade more days and take more trades each day, if you wish to earn more.

Specifics:
TRADE ‚Äì Just trade 3 or 4 days a week and place 1, 2, or more trades on those days, of course if the trades are properly signaled.  Again, you can trade as much as you want to earn more.  You can trade any time you wish, any day you wish, and for as much or as little as you wish.
COMPUTER ‚Äì Use your own home or office computer.  A Windows or Mac operating system is fine.  A simple laptop or desktop is fine.  Having a mouse with your computer is best.
INTERNET ‚Äì Internet connectivity is needed as you will train and trade online.
TEACHABLE ‚Äì You must be willing to learn and follow a system of day trading shown successful for years among thousands we have trained.  Our system is based on principles so you can easily adapt it to what is comfortable to you.
TRADE DEMO TRIAL ‚Äì You will need to complete a Trade Demo Trial to see if day trading our 20+ year system is agreeable with you.  For most the Trade Demo Trial is completed in 10 days to 2 weeks.  The Trade Demo Trial takes just days and with self-initiated signup it is just $10
TRAINING ‚Äì The Trade Demo Trial provides an experience and familiarization.  You will need certifying training to gain the initial skills needed to enter the market successfully and to access your Company funded account. We have a lot of interest, so we ask candidates to share in the cost of training with a reasonable Certifying Training tuition.  Many new Trade Fund Managers simply choose to finance their tuition so it does not come out of their personal budget.  Many of our Trade Fund Manager seek to use their earnings to pay any monthly finance fees and ultimately pay off their tuition.  As such, the tuition never really comes from their personal budget. 
APPOINTMENTS ‚Äì Most of our training is 1-to-1 so we can best ensure your understanding and success.  These appointments will be based upon your scheduled and availability.  We simply need you to keep your online appointments or notify us in advanced.  After training you can day trade anytime and any where you wish.  If you ever need help, just contact us.

We do not have time to micro-manage you.  You will need to keep your initial training appointments and then have the initiative to trade your funded account for your own benefit.  If you are motivated towards success, you can do great and we will be fine.  Its win ‚Äì win.
MONEY MINDED ‚Äì Some people are uncomfortable around money and how to achieve a proper relationship with it.  If you are uncomfortable around money, talking about money, making money, having money, looking for what life can provide with money, looking at the good that can be done and shared with money, etc. then this is not for you.  We can make money and need people comfortable and balanced around money on our team.
BALANCED ‚Äì Simply fit into our culture of balance around driven monetary success, have  an outlook around the good big money can accomplish, and stay in the space of teachable as well as helpful to other traders.  That‚Äôs it!


STEPS
Summary - Day trading may not be for everyone, so we want you to get the initial information you need, try a Trade Demo Trial, and we can go from there.  More specifics follow.

Specifics:
DETAILS - Follow the links for more details and to decide if the Trade Demo Trial is right for you.
TRADE DEMO TRIAL - We will help you with 1-to-1 Trade Demo Trial coaching.  Signup online and there is just a small $10 fee for the 30 day trial.  You can be trading the live market in about a week with a practice account, winning trades and seeing the earnings potential day trading our system.  With our help, the Demo Trial takes about 7 ‚Äì 10 days to know it works for you.
DECIDE - The trial does not teach mastery, but provides you an experience day trading.  You will be able to answer three important questions with the Trade Demo Trial.  (1) Does this 20+ year system work for you with winning trades and seeing its earnings potential?  (2) Are we a company and group of people you can associate with?  (3) Is this the answer to the needs and wants you have?
GET TRAINED - Again, the Demo Trial just gives you awareness of our system.  You will need proper training before trading real money in the market.  You will be trained by active day traders trained and certified as coaches with the Company.  As stated earlier there is a reasonable tuition for Certifying Training that we share with you.  Details are listed at the website.
GET FUNDED -  During training get a real money starter account, so you can begin making money.  You can request more Company trade funding to be added to your Company trade account each 30 days or 90 days your account is positive, based on your level of training.  The more money you have in your trade account, the more money you can make while simply doing the same type and amount of trading.
TRADE - Continuing trading for the results you seek in big extra cash, a lifestyle income, early or more secure retirement, etc. while growing your savings and wealth.  Grow an income into the lifestyle you want and do good for those around you.

It is exhilarating to be on a winning team, especially when winning brings success to others.

Image having the lifestyle income you need and want day trading from home just minutes to an hour or so a day.  Imagine having the money to pay down all the bills, updating the cars, making all the needed repairs and updates to your home or buy the home you really want, start buying and doing the things you need and desire, as well as helping the people around you, and more.

Imagine even retiring early or more securely by day trading our system. You do not have to wait to save for retirement, simply earn it along the way.  Get started and let us train you and then add more and more money to your account as you have positive trade results.  The more money in your account, simply the more money you can earn, with no more time or effort.  Just continue to day trade through retirement and you can enjoy ever increasing profits.  With day trading our system and Company money, create and maintain your lifestyle income while at the same time having increasingly extra income to build your savings, accumulate wealth, and lock in financial security in retirement along the way.  It can be your reality, much like many of our Trade fund Managers.  We have been doing this for years and we know how to help so you can achieve a day trading needs and wants.

It is very clear to all of us that it is now imperative to have an independent secondary, replacement, retirement, or wealth generating income that you control.  Fortunately, it appears things are improving with the COVID-19 issue, the stock market, etc.  Now is the time to put in place an independent income, because we have all experienced that more personal, community, etc. calamities will simply keep occurring.  Having an independent income not connected to a single employer or business, the local or regional economy, etc. is now critical.

See the reality of this for yourself by trying our Trade Demo Trial for a few days.  We will help you with real and live online personalized help.  You can see that this lifestyle is also not that far away and fits into any demanding schedule.  You can experience that it can be done in only minutes to an hour or so a day while trading from the comfort and safety of your home.

We invite and welcome your inquiry.

We want to hire you if you are a good teacher: personable, engaging, and invested in your students' success. If you meet our minimum score requirement of 170 on your official LSAT, we are confident that we can train you to teach the test effectively. If you took the LSAT a while ago and no longer feel like an expert, that's okay. We will help you get back into form. Our starting rate of pay is $60 per hour.

We support our tutors with resources, attention, and training opportunities. We provide you with a visually appealing, highly intuitive curriculum that will ensure you can meet even your most discerning students‚Äô needs. 

This doesn‚Äôt have to be a side job but it can be. Many of our tutors work full-time with us. Others work primarily as lawyers. You can be tutoring full-time for us within weeks. 

Yes, you really can tutor the LSAT full time if you work for us ‚Äì many of our tutors earn comfortable full-time incomes. And you can earn up to $90/hour within months of joining our team.

Part-time is great too! Many of our other tutors run their own legal practices or work for nonprofits. We can offer you whatever amount of work makes sense for your own schedule. Flexible hours mean that you decide when you work ‚Äì we don‚Äôt tell you when to show up to a session; you plan and schedule them with your students. And working from home means that you don‚Äôt have to worry about an annoying commute.

Our baseline requirement is that you scored a 170 or above on the LSAT. More importantly, all of our tutors are expected to be engaging, personable instructors who enjoy helping prospective attorneys achieve a difficult goal. If working one-on-one with a student who is pursuing their dream sounds gratifying to you, we hope you‚Äôll get in touch today.

For more information, please reply to this ad with your resume and LSAT score. Please address your email to Josh. You can also learn more at thelsatnerds.com/hiring.

The LSAT Nerds team believes that our tutoring and admissions assistance should be provided by highly qualified professionals who are representative of the students we teach and the communities we serve. We celebrate diversity and strive for our workforce to include people of all backgrounds. We are united by a desire to empower aspiring young lawyers to succeed.

We all know times are tough. There is record unemployment. Our government is shutting down industries and more people are expected to be out of work soon. Many people dream of opening their own business. Everyone thinks they can be successful if someone would just give them a chance, give them the training they need, and get them the capital they need to get started.

We offer a Business Literacy program created by the FDIC and promoted by the SBA. This 2 to 4 week  business literacy program helps anyone who completes the 13 module SBA/FDIC study program borrow $50,000 to $250,000 (depending on their needs) to start their very own business. We can get them started regardless of their background or credit history.

If you are an independent life insurance agent looking to partner with a professional organization we have the perfect program for you. We don‚Äôt require that you be captive. We don‚Äôt require that you pay us to get started. We don‚Äôt care what state you‚Äôre located in.

A few requirements however:
** Currently licensed and working full-time as a life insurance or annuity agent for no less than three years.
** Organized ‚Äì we won‚Äôt teach you how to stay on top of things.
** Competitive ‚Äì with your previous self and others.
** A Player to the core ‚Äì you despise the status quo and love to grow.
** Continually moving forward.
** A bit OCD ‚Äì not ‚ÄúLaid-back‚Äù
** Able to make a decision and self-manage
** Enjoy group settings and be able to generate and continue conversation.

Do you have a life insurance license? If yes,  are you making less than 100% compensation? If yes, I encourage you to watch our short video below and lets schedule a 15 minute to talk, this time can be a life changer, as it was for me. 

If you are not licensed agent, no worries I was not 8 month ago either, and found a way to make $20,000+ per month! Here is how.

8 month ago I was in a total different type industry for many years and doing well. However,  due to covid-19 my income in April to now became $0, so I started to search for an income replacement.

In April I started studying for my life license, In May I passed my exam -yeah!  The company I was with at the time was all about selling policies to your friends and family plus the compensation was very low. I barely made $900 for a month or very hard work! 

In July I heard about a company FFL that started you at 90% compensation and went as high as 145% 

I also heard they were lead generated, no more selling to friends and family! They sell to people requesting our services!! YEAH that was music to my ears. 

So in July I joined FFL, I went through a week of free training (watch lots of videos on youtube of agents making $25,000+ per month)

In July I made over $9000 income with Family First Life (FFL) and in August over $15,000, I‚Äôm very happy and now making over $20,000 a month.

So why do I post this.. good question. 

I‚Äôm thankful for the opportunity FFL gave me and just wanting to share my story with everyone looking for a career change like me or if you are in life insurance business not making what you‚Äôre worth come join us at FFL. 

I‚Äôm an independent agent at Family First Life Heritage. We are hiring and looking for agents to join our team.

Benefits of working with FFL:
- No contract to sign
- You are independent and can work full time or part-time
- Work from home
- We have excellent FREE training 
- Our average income for full time agent is $120,000 and over $50,000 part time! 
- We represent all top insurance carriers all rated A like Mutual of Omaha, John Hancock, Americo, AIG, Transamerica and lots more! 
- Our compensation starts at 90% and goes to 145%
- We are the largest IMO in USA 
- If you are not licensed we will pay for the course at ExamFX so you can study, pass exam and be licensed.
- I‚Äôll be one of your trainers

Requirements:
- You need a good transportation
- You need a good laptop or tablet
- You need to be teachable
- Positive attitude a PLUS
- Clear Background Check
- 19 years or older
- Hard Working
- Very Teachable

¬†Part-Time or Full Time - We Train (Online from Home)
Work part-time or full time from home trading our corporate funds.¬†
Train Online - Trade Online.
Our Company trade account is BOOMING, and we continue to release new funded accounts to independent contract Fund Managers.
Fund Managers train online to trade online. They trade our Company funds, trading from home 1 or 2 hours a day, 3 to 5 days a week.
Many people are recognizing the importance of having the ability to earn money from home.¬†
The time to get that home-based income flowing is before you need it.¬†
We need Fund Managers now. Our 20+ year proprietary system trading our Company money creates an ideal home-based income.
For over 10 years people have used our system and traded our Company money to create extra income and grow their savings and wealth.¬†
Starting part-time, many of our Fund Managers can create an extra income stream from home. Some even retire early or more securely and continue trading with us working just a few hours a week, while still enjoying a lifestyle income and increasing their savings and wealth.
Our experience over the years has taught us that men and women trading part-time at home are more relaxed and comfortable and make better trades. Today‚Äôs technology combined with our highly accurate trading system make it all possible. With our 20+ year proven system, home day traders do better than so called ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù working all day in an office.¬†
With online Fund Managers, not only are the Company funds growing at a high rate, but the money is at less risk by being diversified over many people and talent.¬†
With this approach, men and women can earn a great home-based, part-time income and we enjoy a higher return on our funds. It‚Äôs truly a win‚Äìwin!
¬†
Click here for details
¬†
POSITION
This is a Fund Manager position where you can trade up to $100,000 of our Company money and keep up to 80% of your trade earnings. TRAIN online from home or your office‚Ä¶and then TRADE online. Most of our fund managers trade just 1 or 2 hours a day. That seems to be enough for them, but you can trade more to earn more. Trade any time the market is open‚Äì 24 hours a day from Sunday 5 pm Eastern to Friday 5 pm Eastern; so, it fits with busy schedules.¬†
As a Fund Manager, you are not an employee trading your time for money. Instead, we provide you with the ability to leverage our training and capital to create something much greater.
We are looking for independent minded, self-starters who essentially want to run their own trade account. You can use the system to trade your own money as well, keeping 100% of your earnings. Many of our Fund Managers do this with their profits from trading the Company funded account.
WE TRAIN YOU¬†
We are committed to your success with extensive 1-on-1 online live personalized training and other online and onsite training formats. Remember you will be trading our money, so we are committed to your training and success.
WE FUND YOU¬†
Part of your education is to trade our Company‚Äôs real money account. You‚Äôll begin with a starter account and quickly grow into a full fund manager trading up to $100,000 of our Company funds.¬†
WE SHOW YOU¬†
Our coaches host 2 daily online trade webinars to show and train how to find and place high-probability trades. Our Fund Managers often see the same trade potential as our coaches and choose to take these same trades.
WE SIGNAL YOU¬†
Using our 20+ year trade system and proprietary trade signals, gives our Fund Managers an edge in the markets.
WE SUPPORT YOU¬†
We provide 1-on-1 live personal support. Call us, text us, email, chat with us, and join in our webinars, seminars, etc.
YOU TRADE¬†
Trade from home or anywhere with a computer and internet connection. You can trade a few minutes to 1 or 2 hours a day, 3 to 5 days a week when the market is open, and it fits with your schedule.
YOU PROFIT¬†
You keep up to 80% of your profits day trading our money. If you choose to trade any of your profits or other private funds you will keep up to 100% of your earnings.
REQUIREMENTS
We ask you to trade a minimum of 3 or 4 days a week and place a couple of trades on those days. Again, you can trade more days and take more trades each day if you wish to earn more.
COMPUTER¬†
Use your own home or office computer. A Windows or Mac operating system will do.¬†
INTERNET¬† 
Internet connectivity is needed as you will train and trade online.
BE TEACHABLE¬†
You must be willing to learn and follow a system of trading proven successful for years among thousands we have trained. Our system is based on principles you can easily adapt to what is comfortable to you.
DEMO TRADING TRIAL¬†
You will need to complete a Demo Trading Trial to see if trading our system is a good fit for you. For most the Demo Trading Trial is completed in 10 days to 2 weeks. The Demo Trading Trial provides you with our proprietary trading software, basic training, access to live trading webinars, and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. You‚Äôll be able to register for just $10 so you can determine if trading with us is right for you.
TRAINING¬†
The Demo Trading Trial provides you with experience and familiarization with our system. Following the trial, you will need certifying training to gain the skills needed to trade successfully in the market and to access your Company Funded Account.¬†
We have extremely high demand for our training, so we ask candidates to share in the cost of training with a reasonable Certifying Training tuition. Many new Fund Managers simply choose to finance their tuition, so it does not come out of their personal budget. Many of our Fund Managers seek to use their earnings to pay any monthly finance fees and ultimately pay off their tuition.
APPOINTMENTS¬†
Most of our training takes place 1-on-1 so we can best ensure your understanding and success. These appointments will be based upon your scheduled and availability. We simply need you to keep your online appointments or notify us in advanced if you cannot attend. After training you can day trade anytime and anywhere you wish. If you ever need help, just contact us.
¬†
Click here for details
¬†
We are committed to your success, as you will be trading our Company money. We know the importance of support for your success, so all our support is live and personal. We have a helpful community of traders and we are looking for people that fit well within a teachable, helpful, and success-based culture.
DRIVEN¬†
We are looking for independent, self-starting, success-minded people. You will not be an employee but an independent contractor. We do not have time to micro-manage you. You will need to keep your training appointments, attend webinars, and take demo trades in order to continue in our program. If you are motivated towards success, this could be a life-changing opportunity.
MONEY-MINDED¬†
If you are uncomfortable around money, talking about money, making money, having money, looking for what life can provide with money, looking at the good that can be done and shared with money, etc. then this is not for you. Our goal is to make money and we need people who are comfortable and balanced around money on our team.
STEPS
Day trading may not be for everyone, so we want you to experience it and get some basic training by trying our Demo Trading Trial. After the trial, you will be able to determine if trading our trading system and trading our company money is a good fit for you.
¬†
Click here for more details and to decide if the Demo Trading Trial is right for you.
¬†
DEMO TRADING TRIAL¬†
We will help you with 1-on-1 Demo Trading Trial coaching. Signup online and there is just a small $10 fee for the 30-day trial. You can be trading the live market in a few days with a practice account, winning trades and seeing the earning potential trading our system. With our help, it takes about 10‚Äì14 days for most people to determine if trading with us is right for them.
The trial does not teach mastery but provides you an experience day trading. You will be able to answer three important questions with the Demo Trading Trial‚Äì
1. Does this system work for you with winning trades and seeing its earnings potential?¬†
2. Is trading something you enjoy?
3. Are we a company and group of people you want to associate with?¬†
GET TRAINED¬†
Again, the Demo Trading Trial just gives you awareness of our system. You will need proper training before trading real money in the market. You will be trained by active traders trained and certified as coaches in our system. As stated earlier there is a reasonable tuition for Certifying Training that we share with you.
GET FUNDED¬†
During training get a starter account, so you can begin making money. You can request additional trade account funding each 30 or 90 days when your account is positive, based on your level of training. The more money you have in your trade account, the more money you can make while simply doing the same type and amount of trading.
TRADE¬†
Continue trading for the results you seek, whether that‚Äôs extra income, growing your savings or wealth, early or more secure retirement, etc. Grow into the life you want and do good for those around you.
¬†
Click here for details
¬†
It is exhilarating to be on a winning team, especially when winning brings success to others.
Imagine having the lifestyle and income you need and want, trading from home just minutes to an hour or two a day.
Imagine even retiring early or more securely by day trading our system. You do not have to wait to save for retirement, simply earn it along the way. Get started and let us train you and then add more and more money to your account as you have positive trade results.¬†
The more money in your account, the more money you can earn with no additional time or effort. Just continue to trade through retirement and you can enjoy ever increasing profits. By trading our system and Company money, create and maintain your lifestyle while at the same time having increasingly extra income to build your savings, accumulate wealth, and lock in financial security in retirement. It can be your reality, much like many of our Fund Managers. We have been doing this for years and we know how to help you achieve your financial goals.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that it is now imperative to have an independent secondary, replacement, retirement, or wealth generating income. Now is the time to put in place an independent income. Having an independent income not connected to a single employer or business, the local or regional economy, etc. is now critical.
See the reality of this for yourself by trying our Demo Trading Trial. We will help you with real and live online personalized help. You can see that this lifestyle is also not that far away and fits into any demanding schedule. You can experience that it can only take minutes to an hour or two a day while trading from the comfort and safety of your home.
We invite and welcome your inquiry. ","

Equivity works closely with our clients to provide them with virtual assistants who are experienced in their field and have successfully worked in a remote or virtual environment. Our law firm clients range from solo practitioners to multi-partner firms, and run across all specialty areas of law including litigation, family law, bankruptcy, real estate, and much more.

WHO IS PRESS LIKE?
Press Like is the number one platform helping modern real estate agents succeed on social media without having to do any of the work themselves. Even though some businesses are struggling through these tough times, interest rates just hit record lows, and the real estate industry across America is booming! Based on a recent study done by the National Association of Realtors, 74% of home buyers and sellers will look up Realtors social media presence before calling them to do business. So it is no longer a choice for them to have a unique social media presence to separate themselves from their competition; they need one! We are currently the industry leader trusted by the largest real estate brokerages on the planet. At Press Like, we may have a start-up vibe, but this is not our first rodeo. We've been in this space for eight years and serviced thousands of clients, and we are growing daily!

NOW HIRING
1099 work from home phone sales consultants to support our outstanding growth in the US market. Full-time sales positions will bring in on average $900-$1,900 per week. Part-time sales positions will make less depending on the hours that you put in. If you show promise, learn the structure, produce consistent sales, show leadership qualities, you could be put on a fast track to management and be trained how to help newer people get off to a great start. That is also a very lucrative position. The management team works around the clock to help with your success. You will have the opportunity to call Realtors Monday through Friday during their business hours. We have daily Zoom meetings on the weekdays where we roleplay with each other and share sales techniques to get better every day. There is a beautiful bonus structure, daily jackpots, along with weekly and monthly bonuses that reward consistency to ensure that you will always make a great living while growing along the way.

WHAT TO EXPECT
We have lots of training videos and scripts for you to go over before you start. There is live in-call coaching with lots of virtual meetings and role-playing to improve yourself daily. You log onto our system with a good internet connection and a headset with a microphone. Within 1 minute of logging in, a real estate agent with all of their information will connect to your headset.

And yes, we do wear kilts, which along with dependability, outstanding customer service and flawless execution, defines our brand.

Let‚Äôs Start with You

We hire two types of people at Men In Kilts: Those looking for a career and those looking for a job as a steppingstone to help them along the way to their dream job.

If you are looking for a stepping stone, we can offer you a position as a window cleaning, gutter cleaning and power washing technician where, over a year or two, you can gain valuable and transferable experience and skills that will equip you to move on to your next career step or life goal.

What Can We Offer - Starting hourly wage with room for growth + Bonus Opportunities

We compensate our technicians through a revenue-sharing model where the harder you work, the more you make, while delivering exceptional service and making people smile. Your drive, work ethic and results will determine how much you make. If you just want to show up and punch a clock, this isn't for you.

More Reasons You Should Want This Job

Freedom and Flexibility ‚Äì You will work independently with no micromanaging. We train and empower you to provide the best possible service to our customers, and we will trust that you will do just that. A positive attitude and friendly personality are what we are looking for. We will teach you the skills.

Satisfaction from Making a Difference and Bringing a Smile to Someone‚Äôs Face - Whether it is delighting a customer with a clean windows, gutters or siding, or just having someone stop you in the street to take your picture, you can feel good about what you do and how you are improving someone else‚Äôs life.

Who Succeeds at Men In Kilts?

We're looking for motivated, goal-oriented individuals who work hard and work smart, to provide an outstanding experience to our customers. Our successful team members also:

- Represent our company with integrity and passion
- Treat our customers like gold
- Safely and efficiently operate our fleet of tartan trucks and maintain our equipment
- Process payments and paperwork (digitally, as we are striving to be a paperless company)
- Engage in a range of business development activities, including distributing marketing materials and participating in the occasional community event
- Thrive working outdoors (rain or shine)
- Have a valid driver‚Äôs license
- Able to lift/carry up to 65 pounds for short periods of time
- Be able to work in temperatures ranging from 25 degrees to 105 degrees
- Are motivated by being part of an exceptional team with shared goals
- Are ready and willing to wear a kilt every day and enjoy the resulting attention!

Comments from a current Carroll Fulmer Driver on social media‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..



 
""Love Carroll Fulmer Logistics, been with em two years now. Always good miles, I average 2800-3200 every week and go home 7 days. I'm always home on time or early. Never late. They always take personal attention to my personal needs and my family. Helped me out during hard times, or sickness. When I'm given a load, I'm offered usually two or three options and asked, when can I pick it up, and when can I deliver it. I always have 1 or 2 preplans ahead of time. No swaps unless it works in your favor. Road service is easy to get ahold of. And best of all, no micromanagement. Great feel without the big company BS. They really do make you feel like family here. I've even had no problem speaking to the President personally before and it was a very pleasant experience."" ‚Äî Troy Townsend, Carroll Fulmer Driver
